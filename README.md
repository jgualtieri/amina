This is the README for the Amina app.  Amina is designed to provide users with crucial, potentially lifesaving information.  Amina has two main functions - the first is to provide lifesaving content in the form of videos containing health and safety information and the second is to provide useful information about locations through crowdsourcing.

To learn more about the Amina app, please visit https://tobesafe.squarespace.com.  This website provides information about the purpose, design, and implementation of the Amina application.

Requirements: Users of Amina must have a Google account.  While the content hosted by Amina does not require an internet connection, a connection must be made at some point to gather location information from other users.  However, once the location information is synchronaized, it can be accessed locally without an internet connection.
